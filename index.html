    <h2>ABOUT Zocalo</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Zocalo, we can't wait for you to try our tacos. Our tacos are

      margaritas are made with hand squeezed lime and expertly crafted. Sergio &

      excellent authentic and creative fusion Mexican dishes in a fun and
      inviting atmosphere.

      Sergio is an award wining Mexican chef who had been featured a couple of
      times on the Cooking Channel and Food Network. He has been invited to make
      food for Michael Phelps, his foundation and other celebrity guests.
      Nothing makes Sergio more happy than to please his customers with the
      authentic tastes of Mexico.

      Lindsey loved to use her design background to create the fun and laid back
      atmosphere of Zocalo. Picture a boho beachside taco stand in Tulum Mexico,
      and you have Zocalo. There is a VW bus inside the restaurant for customers
      to order at, a longboard leaning again the pergola over the bar, swings at
      the counters, basket lights and a jungle of plants. Enjoy your visit to
      Zocalo and we hope to see you soon!
