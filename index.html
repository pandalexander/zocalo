        Welcome to Zocalo, we can't wait for you to try our tacos. Our tacos are
        made with love and passed down from many generations. All of our
        margaritas are made with hand squeezed lime and expertly crafted. Sergio
        & his wife Lindsey are driven by their passionate pursuit to bring you
        excellent authentic and creative fusion Mexican dishes in a fun and
        inviting atmosphere.

        Sergio is an award wining Mexican chef who had been featured a couple of
        times on the Cooking Channel and Food Network. He has been invited to
        make food for Michael Phelps, his foundation and other celebrity guests.
        Nothing makes Sergio more happy than to please his customers with the
        authentic tastes of Mexico.

        Lindsey loved to use her design background to create the fun and laid
        back atmosphere of Zocalo. Picture a boho beachside taco stand in Tulum
        Mexico, and you have Zocalo. There is a VW bus inside the restaurant for
        customers to order at, a longboard leaning again the pergola over the
        bar, swings at the counters, basket lights and a jungle of plants. Enjoy
        your visit to Zocalo and we hope to see you soon!
